“Watch With Friends”

## What is a Educated Guess?

A media platform where users learn what their friends watch. TV and streaming options have never been better and yet everyone just watches the same stuff. Until now. With educated guess - you can discover media thats less heavily marketed yet beloved by your friends. And also avoid wasting time on schlok. 

## Why do we need EG?

To get access to your friends recommendations at the click of a button (or possibly a question to alexa). 

## Before EG:
User:"uhhhh its same stuff on Netflix i dont know what to watch waaaaaaaa"

## After EG:
User:"omg Christie watched "BodyGuard" im totally gonna check it out, she has awesome taste!"
